# Particle Swarm Optimization

The purpose of this project is to show the use of **PSO** (Particle Swarm Optimization) methods in minimization problems. This particular example is focused on finding the minimal value of a function. It is applied only for two dimensional functions (which made possible to graphically represent algorithm's execution) but can be extended to any number of dimensions. Used functions:
- Sphere
- Griewangk
- Rastrigin
- Rosenbock

For more details (formula/representation) on optimisation functions (including the used ones) consult this [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization).

Another swarm intelligence based algorithm can be found here - [Ant Colony Optimization](https://github.com/iulian-stan/AntColonyOptimization).

## Solution
By running the application it can be seen that the system is initialized with a randomly placed **_particles_** - which represents the initial solution in the function's visible domain. It tries to improve the solution gradually moving each particle closer to a possible solution. Eventually all particles will gather in a single point representing the minimal value.

## Interface
![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iulian-stan/ParticleSwarmOptimization/502a390653387d3233d84223d3d5d66206923721/demo.PNG)

There is a graphical representation of the problem on the left side and control panel on the right.

### Graphic
The functions origin is in the middle of the image, the color represents function value taking each points coordinates as input values, the dots represent the **_particles_**.

### Control
Parameters:
* **Population** size - particles number
* **Delay** - small freeze time used in simulation
* **Optimization function** - mentioned above
* **Algorithm**
  * Base - particle's position shifting is determined equaly by all other particles
  * Initial weight - in addition to base case it adds a coefficient to the previous shifting (other way said it sets previous step position importance)
  * Constriction factor - the entire formula from base case is scaled by a factor
* **Topology**
  * Full - each particle is affected by the entire population
  * Ring - each particle is affected only by two neigbours
  * 4-neighbours - each particle is affected by 4 neighbours
* **Coeficients**
  * φ1 - individual influence (how much te movement is affected by individual position)
  * φ2 - social infuence (how much te movement is affected by other's particles position)
  * w/ψ - initial weight or constriction factor (depending on selected algorithm)
